## Session Overview

Welcome to the Doctoral Urban Planning Seminar! During our introductory session, we'll spend some time discussing our shared agenda for the semester. We will also discuss your individual goals and things you'd like to accomplish during the seminar.

## Before we Meet

- Please familiarize yourself with this website including the [seminar information](../syllabus/syllabus.qmd) section and [schedule](schedule.qmd).
- Read a funding proposal - this could be a proposal submitted by a fellow student or a faculty member. Be prepared to share your reactions.

## After we Meet

- Take a few moments to reflect on what your own funding goals are right now:
    - What would funding help you do that you cannot do with the resources you have? 
    - Why should others care about funding your work?

- Identify two funding opportunities you'd like to explore over the course of the semester. Be ready to share why you selected them.
