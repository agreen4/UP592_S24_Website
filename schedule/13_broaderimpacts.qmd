## Session Overview

Many funders are interested in understanding the impacts of research beyond it's scholarly value. For those of us in applied research fields like planning, these broader impacts arguments are often particularly important. During this session, we'll consider how to make arguments around broader impacts, connect our work to communities and institutions, and also explore other strategies for effective communication of complex information related to our work.
